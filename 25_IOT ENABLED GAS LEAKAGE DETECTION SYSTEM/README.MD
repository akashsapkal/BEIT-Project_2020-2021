Description: Gas leakage is a major problem with industrial sector, residential premises and gas powered
vehicles like CNG (compressed natural gas) buses, cars. One of the preventive methods
to stop accident associated with the gas leakage is to install gas leakage detection kit at
vulnerable places. The aim of this paper is to present such a design that can automatically
detect and stop gas leakage in vulnerable premises. In particular gas sensor has been used
which has high sensitivity for propane (C3H8) and butane (C4H10). Gas leakage system
consists of GSM (Global System for mobile communications) module, which warns by sending
SMS and webserver for continuously monitoring . However, the former gas leakage system
cannot react in time.
